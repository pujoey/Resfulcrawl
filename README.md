### Behind the scenes

Behind every successful project there are countless hours dedicated towards planning, organizing and communicating project tasks, goals, milestones and issues. We invite to see the specific tools and framewords we used for this project:


* Visit our [slides.com](http://goo.gl/kQ1zjY) to see the project presentation we created on-deck. 
* Visit our [trello.com](https://trello.com/b/SMSwN4DV/five-guys) to see how we organized, planned and communicated our goals, our milestones and our issues.
* Daily [stand up meetings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) to communicate blockers, work-in-progress and up-coming tasks.

### Project requirements

Our team must:

- **Present an idea** to the instructors with a **deck**,
  covering the period of [project inception][inception], that includes:
  - a list of included technologies
  - a list of third-party APIs consumed (if any)
  - which OAuth provider(s) your app will use for authentication
  - wireframes for the central interactions, and
  - an underlying data model.
- **Document your app's RESTful API**.
- **Craft thoughtful user stories together**, as a team, and manage
  and distribute those user stories to team members based on skills and
  interests using **Trello**.
- **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using Git, GitHub and
  a standard team work-flow.
- **Present the app at the end of the sprint** as a team.
- **Perform a team-wide retro** and at least one **code-review** after
  the completion of the sprint.

The app must:

- Use **MongoDB & Express** to CRUD your data.
- **Produce a RESTful API that exposes at least one model**.
- **Consume its own API using AJAX**.
- **Authenticate users using at least one OAuth provider**.
- **Restrict access to the Creation, Updating & Deletion of resource(s) 
  using an authorization middleware function**.
- Be **deployed online** using **Heroku**.

You do not need to, but may:

- Make a single-page app (SPA); you can have multiple views and EJS as
  necessary, due to technical constraints.
- Use Web Sockets; while you must use AJAX to dynamically generate
  HTML from a JSON API, you may or may not add a Web Socket interface.
